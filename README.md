### Social-Links-and-Predicable-Returns

It is always a hope of finance researchers and practitioners to understand the mystery of stock price dynamics and forecast stock prices. This project attempts to use the board of directors data of listed companies to achieve this goal.

The theory underlying predictable stock prices is that the efficient market hypothesis(EMH) is not satisfied in practice. This means the stock prices do not reflect the information in the markets immediately, and hence some past information has predictive power for the future stock prices. These predictivity can be roughly characterized into two classes: the momentum effect and the reversal effect. The momentum effect represents a positive relationship between past and future stock prices, meaning that an upward price movement in the past suggests an upward movement in the future and vice versa, whereas the reversal effect defines the negative relationship.

I mainly contributed to writing the codes to construct such a social link momentum factor. If you are interested in the theories and experimental results, please refer to the [recent progress](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4477466) of the main authors for a more formal exposition.

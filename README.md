### Social-Links-and-Predicable-Returns

It is always a hope of finance researchers and practitioners to understand the mystery of stock price dynamics and forecast stock prices. This project attempts to use the board of directors data of listed companies to achieve this goal.

The theory underlying predictable stock prices is that the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is not satisfied in practice. This means the stock prices do not reflect the information in the markets immediately, and hence some past information has predictive power for the future stock prices. These predictivity can be roughly characterized into two classes: the momentum effect and the reversal effect. The momentum effect represents a positive relationship between past and future stock prices, meaning that an upward price movement in the past suggests an upward movement in the future and vice versa, whereas the reversal effect defines the negative relationship. 

Among the numerous attempts, the data beyond traditional resources like company filings and financial statements, known as alternative data, demonstrates high potential in forecast stock prices. As the data is rarely available, the valuable information is it can slowly be incorporated into the stock prices. The board of directors data falls into this category. Luckily, a visionary company [Boardex](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4477466) sees the value in the data of executive directors and carefully collects it for years. We make use of their data. 

The project is motivated by the hypothesis that there is a cross predictability momentum effect 

I mainly contributed to writing the codes to construct such a social link momentum factor(this repository). If you are interested in the theories and experimental results, please refer to the [recent progress](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4477466) of the main authors for a more formal exposition and references. 

Next, I introduce the structure of the codes.
